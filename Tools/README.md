these are Arduino codes which will help in building the signalscope

**i2c_Scanner** - to check which I2C address each I2C module uses, in the case that you use different components than i did
**ICM20948_Calibration** - to find magnetometer and accelerometer offsets of the IMU. (use code when ESP32 and all other compoenents are in their respective places on the device)
